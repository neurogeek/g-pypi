Misc improvements:

Do a third pass on ebuild(s) created and add the version installed for all (R)DEPENDs if the version information is missing.

e.g. 
  
  DEPEND=dev-python/setuptools

would be re-written on the third pass as

  DEPEND=dev-python/setuptools-0.6_rc8-r1

I say third pass because first a skeleton ebuild is written with the basics, then the ebuild Manifest is created, it's unpacked and ${S} may be written on the second pass.
